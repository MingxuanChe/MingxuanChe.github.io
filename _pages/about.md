As a master's student in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, I am interested in combining model-based control algorithms with machine learning methods for safe and high-performance robotic applications in uncertain and dynamic environments. 
I finished my master's thesis at the [Learning Systems and Robotics Lab](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/lsy/home/) supervised by [Prof. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/), [Dr. SiQi Zhou](https://siqizhou.com/) and [Lukas Brunke](https://www.lukasbrunke.com/).
Recently, I am working as reserach assistant on benchmarking learning-based control and reinforcement learning in the same lab.  

Before joining the Learning Systems and Robotics Lab, I wrote my semester thesis at the [Chair of Information-oriented Control](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/itr/home/) under the supervision of [Dr. Junjie Jiao](https://junjiejiao.github.io/) at the same University. Prior to that, I worked as student assistant at the [Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Embedded Systems](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/home/) and [Chair of Automatic Control Engineering, TUM](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lsr/home/)

<!-- **Student Theses**
  I am open to supervising ambitious and talented master's and bachelor's students for their thesis. If you want to work with me, please send me an email describing your area of interest. Please also attach your CV and up-to-date transcripts. -->
